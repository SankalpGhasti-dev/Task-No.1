1. What is an open port?
->> An open port means a service running on that port and is ready to accept connections from other devices.

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
->> Nmap send TCP SYN packet to the target port. If it receives SYN-ACK, then the port is considered as open. if it recieves RST, then the port is considered closed. Nmap then sends an RST to terminate 
    the connection.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?
->> Open ports increase a system's attack surface. Attackers can exploit vulnerable services running on open ports to gain unauthorized access, perform brute-force attacks, inject malware, or steal data.

4. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP scanning.
->> TCP scanning checks ports using connection-based communication and is faster and more reliable because TCP responses clearly indicate whether a port is open or closed and UDP scanning checks 
    connectionless ports and is slower and less reliable because UDP does not send acknowledgments, so Nmap must wait for ICMP responses or timeouts.

5. How can open ports be secured?
->> By closing unnecessary ports, using firewalls, updating services, and restricting access.

6. What is a firewall's role regarding ports?
->> A firewall controls network traffic by allowing or blocking access to ports based on security rules, helping prevent unauthorized connections and protecting services from attacks.            

7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
->> A port scan checks which ports are open on a system. Attackers use it to find weak or vulnerable services.

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
->> Nmap finds open ports, and Wireshark lets you see the actual network packets, helping analyze and confirm scan behavior.
